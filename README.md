# Travelling Salesman Problem
Final project for AP Computer Science in the 2017-2018 school year

Application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a>, or TSP. This does not always find the shortest possible route between the points, but is more of a proof-of-concept for being able to attempt it. Currently, this is how it works:

> Given a collection of points with Cartesian coordinates, starting at the specified "origin" point, iterate through all the possible paths between all of the other points, finding the shortest of those paths, and continue from the corresponding point until the "destination" point is reached
